# Comments from Samtrafiken

The comments are unordered and unprioritised.

## General

1. All APIs will of course need to be synced with latest available APIs.
2. Objects seem to be missing required fields (we've added a few).
3. All new fields should have example values (in english where applicable).
4. HTTP status codes should be added. One example is:
   1. 400 Bad Request - in some places, where maybe certain combination of parameters don't work together

## Ticket API

4. <code>ticketUpdateRequest</code>, the text for startOfValidity seems to be copy-pasted from somewhere. There is in essence no manifest here.

## Traveller API

8. Somewhere describe when a wallet is created? By which system?
